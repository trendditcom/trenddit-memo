Study the README.md and images/ folder contents. Identify appropriate section in the README.md where to place each of the images linking back to valid location of these images in the GitHub repo so that the images render correctly. Do not place an image more than once. Use GitHub Pages friendly HTML to style the images and captions so that image proportions match the container and also offer great readability and elegant look and feel.
