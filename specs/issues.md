# Issues

[ ] When Ollama is selected. Capture action does not start LLM processing. Get this error: Error processing memo: Error: Provider not initialized.


[x] When Ollama is selected and content is captured the memo is not saved.

[x] Repeat issue, not fixed. Research online to find a solution. Uncaught ReferenceError: initializeOllamaEventListeners is not defined. Context: sidepanel.html. Line 347: initializeOllamaEventListeners();

[x] This is still not fixed. Add browser developer console debug messages for helping fix his. Test the Ollama API connection. Research online about access localhost Ollama REST API using Chrome browser extension. Repeating Error: When Ollama provider is selected the models drop down does not list installed models. Refresh Models link does not do anything. There is a constant message belore models dropdown "Checking service..."

[x] Review the tests in the project and configure the test runner correctly

[x] When I stat Chat with Memos and enter first prompt, sometimes I get the response "I apologize, but I encountered an error. Please try again". Second turn results in response from LLM as expected.

[x] Connection test failed: Google AI API authentication failed: Gemini connection test failed: Gemini response blocked: MAX_TOKENS


[x] When loading the extension first time or clicking Capture after saving settings for any model provider I see - Error checking provider configuration: ReferenceError: providerConfigManager is not defined

[x] When I save Gemini key I get this error however the capture memo works with model provider selected as Gemini: Failed to initialize provider: Error: Google AI API authentication failed: Gemini connection test failed: No response generated by Gemini


[x] Once settings for model selection is saved for a model which is not first on the dropdown list, going back to settings screen resets the dropdown to first model on the list instead of persisting the selection saved earlier. 

[x] Anthropic key is not persisted when going to settings screen after providing it in the sidepanel loading modal.

[x] Remove the Title "Anvam AI Memo" and model provider indicator from toolbar. Instead provide only model provider just below the toolbar right aligned using text like - Using Gemini.

[x] On loading the sidepanel for first time and setting Anthropic key, the model provider shows "no provider configured"

[x] Test connection on OpenAI settings gives error - Connection test failed: OpenAI API authentication failed: OpenAI connection test failed: Provider not initialized. Call initialize() first.

[x] Update OpenAI models selection using https://platform.openai.com/docs/models and use o4-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini


[x] When testing Genini connection I get error - Connection test failed: Google AI API authentication failed: Gemini connection test failed: Provider not initialized. Call initialize() first.


[x] Next to the title "Trenddit Memo" provide a tiny font model provider indicator like (using Gemini)

[x] Test connection returns really fast. Are you actually testing an LLM call for testing connection?


[x] When selecting Gemini model and capturing memo I see processing notification but saved memo does not show up. I get Error processing memo: Error: Failed to parse Gemini response as JSON.

[x] When I select Settings, then select Memos, I still see settings screen below Memos screen. It hides when I click on any other menu like tags and come back to memos.

[x] Error processing memo: Error: Unrecognized request arguments supplied: tags, url



[x] For Gemini models use https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models and provide options for Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash

[x] For Anthropic models use https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview and provide options for Claude Opus 4, Sonnet 4, Sonnet 3.7, Sonnet 3.5v2, and Haiku 3.5

[x] Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word
Context: sidepanel.html

```

[x] Service worker registration failed. Status code: 15


[x] I am not able to choose my AI provider. I only get an option to add Anthropic key like prior feature release
[x] Settings screen only shows Anthropic key
