## Roadmap

This roadmap is ordered from top to bottom by priority of development.

[x] Multi-LLM Integration (Phases 1-4): Complete multi-provider system implemented - provider base class, factory pattern, configuration management system, full UI integration, and comprehensive testing completed. Anthropic provider refactored to new architecture. OpenAI and Google Gemini providers fully implemented and integrated. Users can now select from 3 LLM providers with seamless switching, provider-specific model selection, connection testing, and unified error handling. All tests pass and documentation updated.

[x] Local LLM Integration: Enable users to choose Ollama as a model provider - Complete Ollama provider implementation with factory integration, configuration management, UI integration, service detection, model discovery, and comprehensive testing. Users can now run AI models locally for privacy and offline use. Includes connection testing, error handling, and seamless switching between local and cloud providers. Full test coverage and documentation completed.

[x] Extended Content Sources (Phase 1 - YouTube): Capture and process content from YouTube videos directly within the extension. Complete YouTube integration with automatic page detection and processing without hover/selection UI. Features include video metadata capture (title, author, duration, views, description), thumbnail display, transcript extraction via video.google.com API with DOM fallback, specialized content processing pipeline, platform-specific UI styling, and comprehensive testing. Users can now save YouTube videos as memos with full video metadata and transcript analysis. Includes platform detection, specialized memo data structure, and seamless integration with all LLM providers.

[ ] Extended Content Sources (Phase 2+): Complete Twitter/X integration and additional social media platforms (Reddit, LinkedIn, Instagram) with modular content extractor framework.

[ ] Rich Media Support: Process and analyze images, videos, and audio content, enabling comprehensive multi-media content capture and organization.

[ ] Advanced Format Handling: Import and process content from markdown files, PDFs, and other document formats while preserving structure and formatting.

[ ] Enhanced Content Analysis: Implement sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and advanced content categorization to provide deeper insights into captured content.

[ ] Data Visualization: Generate interactive charts, graphs, and visual representations of content relationships and insights.

[ ] Content Distribution: Share memos and insights via email, SMS, and other communication channels directly from the extension.

[ ] Collaborative Features: Enable memo sharing and collaborative content organization among team members or research groups.

[ ] Task Management Integration: Convert memos into actionable items like to-do lists, checklists, and project milestones.

[ ] Calendar Integration: Create calendar events, schedule meetings, and set reminders based on memo content and insights.

[ ] Automated Workflows: Implement AI agents that can execute tasks based on memo content, such as creating shopping lists or scheduling appointments.

[ ] System Integration: Enable the extension to interact with system applications, creating spreadsheets, performing web searches, and managing files based on memo content and user objectives.
