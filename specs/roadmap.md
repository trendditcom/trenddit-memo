## Future Roadmap

This roadmap is ordered from top to bottom by priority of development.

### Code Improvement Recommendations for Future Readiness

#### 1. Refactor for Multi-LLM Support
- **Extract LLM-specific logic**: Create a more robust provider interface that standardizes request/response handling across different LLM providers
- **Configuration management**: Implement a centralized configuration system that can handle multiple API keys and provider-specific settings
- **Request/response adapters**: Build adapter pattern implementations for each LLM provider to normalize their different API structures
- **Error handling standardization**: Create a unified error handling system that can gracefully handle provider-specific failures

#### 2. Modularize Content Processing Pipeline
- **Extract content processors**: Create separate modules for different content types (HTML, PDF, video, audio) with a common interface
- **Implement pipeline architecture**: Build a flexible processing pipeline that can chain different processors based on content type
- **Plugin system**: Design a plugin architecture for adding new content sources without modifying core code
- **Content type detection**: Implement robust content type detection and automatic processor selection

#### 3. Enhance Storage Architecture
- **Repository pattern**: Implement repository pattern for data access to abstract storage implementation details
- **Data migration system**: Build a migration system to handle future schema changes
- **Storage adapter pattern**: Create adapters for different storage backends (local, sync, cloud)
- **Caching layer**: Add a caching layer to improve performance and reduce API calls

#### 4. Improve Message Bus Architecture
- **Event-driven architecture**: Replace direct message passing with an event bus for better decoupling
- **Command/Query separation**: Implement CQRS pattern for clearer separation of concerns
- **Message queue**: Add a message queue for handling long-running operations
- **WebSocket support**: Prepare for real-time collaboration features

#### 5. Create Extension Framework
- **Feature flags**: Implement feature flag system for gradual rollout of new features
- **Module loader**: Build dynamic module loading system for optional features
- **Dependency injection**: Implement DI container for better testability and modularity
- **Extension API**: Create public API for third-party extensions

### Strategies for Modular, Extensible, and Maintainable Code

#### 1. Architecture Patterns
- **Implement Clean Architecture**: Separate business logic from infrastructure concerns
- **Use Domain-Driven Design**: Create clear domain models and bounded contexts
- **Apply SOLID principles**: Refactor existing code to follow Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles
- **Adopt Hexagonal Architecture**: Create ports and adapters for external dependencies

#### 2. Code Organization
- **Module boundaries**: Create clear module boundaries with well-defined interfaces
- **Layered architecture**: Organize code into presentation, business logic, and data layers
- **Feature-based structure**: Reorganize files by feature rather than by type
- **Shared utilities**: Extract common utilities into a shared module

#### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Unit test coverage**: Add comprehensive unit tests for all business logic
- **Integration tests**: Create integration tests for API interactions
- **E2E tests**: Implement end-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- **Mock providers**: Build mock implementations of external services for testing

#### 4. Development Practices
- **TypeScript migration**: Convert JavaScript files to TypeScript for better type safety
- **Code documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to all public APIs
- **Design patterns**: Document and implement common design patterns consistently
- **Code review checklist**: Create checklist for maintaining code quality

#### 5. Performance Optimization
- **Lazy loading**: Implement lazy loading for features and modules
- **Bundle optimization**: Split code into smaller bundles for faster loading
- **Memory management**: Add memory leak detection and prevention
- **Performance monitoring**: Implement performance tracking and optimization

#### 6. Security Enhancements
- **Input validation**: Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Security headers**: Implement additional security headers and CSP rules
- **Encryption**: Add encryption for sensitive data in storage
- **Audit logging**: Implement security audit logging

#### 7. Developer Experience
- **Development tools**: Add development tools like hot reloading and debugging utilities
- **Build optimization**: Improve build process with better caching and incremental builds
- **Documentation**: Create comprehensive developer documentation
- **CLI tools**: Build CLI tools for common development tasks

#### 8. Reliability and Monitoring
- **Error tracking**: Integrate error tracking and monitoring
- **Health checks**: Add health check endpoints for critical services
- **Circuit breakers**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for external services
- **Graceful degradation**: Ensure all features degrade gracefully
